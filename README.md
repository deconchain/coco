# 🐓 $COCO – A Rural Web3 Protocol for Real-World Autonomy

## 🌾 About
$COCO is an open-source protocol designed to embody a different vision of Web3:
**low-tech, sovereign, and rooted in rural life**.

No buzz. No marketing.  
Just a decentralized system born under the sun, near the hens, and close to the earth.

- Built from scratch by a former Web1/early Web2 contributor
- Developed in a countryside lab with offline habits and open hardware
- Powered by chickens, solar panels, and human stubbornness

> **"I say: I'm back. With boots, eggs, and $COCO."**
## 🧑‍🌾 Philosophy

- 🐣 **Reboot Rural**: a call to the developers who left the hype to reconnect with the soil.
- 🌐 **Minimal Stack**: lightweight and forkable. If you have a Linux terminal, you can run $COCO.
- 💻 **Copilot-First**: Designed to be extended with LLM prompts or bash scripts.
- 📜 **Immutability** over virality. We code once, so others can reuse forever.

## 📦 What Is $COCO?
$COCO is a **symbolic and modular crypto primitive**:

- A small base for value, contribution, and reward systems
- Suitable for **micro-economies**, **crypto-farms**, **local DAOs**, or **artistic projects**
- Easily adaptable to your village, your poultry operation, or your next decentralized tale

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- Base: GitHub-hosted logic, transparent and open (Apache 2.0)
- Extensions: AI copilots (GPT-style), bash CLI, or Solana/EVM bridges
- Designed for **offline-first**, **low-power**, and **decentralized systems**

## 🫂 Contribute
You can:
- Fork and adapt to your region or farm
- Submit merge requests with small poetic or technical additions
- Add your own reboot story (check `people.md`)

> 👣 No Discord. No Telegram.  
> Contributions are welcome the Web1 way: quietly and with code.
