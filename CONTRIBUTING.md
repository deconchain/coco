# How to Contribute – DeconChain Project

This is a **hybrid project**: a mix of code, community, and democratic governance.  
We welcome anyone who wants to help — technical or not.

## 🧩 Ways to Contribute

- Suggest new ideas (open an **Issue**)
- Improve documentation (edit `.md` files)
- Write code (see open issues labeled `help wanted`)
- Propose governance models (votes, citizen tools)

## ✍️ Process

1. Fork the repo
2. Create a new branch (`feature-xyz`)
3. Submit a **Pull Request**
4. Wait for review and feedback

We use English, but simple language. If you prefer French, it's okay in Issues or comments.

## 📄 Code and File Rules

- Code is under `src/`, config in `config/`, docs in root
- Do **not** push directly to `main` – use Pull Requests
- For legal/policy files (`policy.md`, `security.md`), only **maintainers** can merge changes

## 📜 Contributor License

By contributing, you agree your work is shared under the project’s licenses (AGPL & CC-BY-SA).

## 🧠 Tips

- Small commits are better
- Explain your changes clearly
- Ask questions if you’re not sure — we’re here to help!
