# 🧑‍🌾 Who is DeconChain?

DeconChain is not just a project.  
It is a **field signal**, a **mesh of minds**, a **cooperative hallucination** rooted in rural soil and digital flow.

Some are real.  
Some are shadows.  
Some are no longer alive, yet still commit.

## 🌾 Core Nodes

- **Jean Petit**  
  Whispers across fields. Possibly a shepherd. Possibly a router.

- **Alice D.**  
  Archives policies and poems. Might be a bot trained on civic code + myth.

- **C. M.**  
  Writes governance models on the back of dead philosophers. Responds only during storms.

## 🔍 Why This Ambiguity?

Because politics today needs mystery.  
Because open source doesn't mean open identity.  
Because the future may not have fixed roles — only **flows**, **fields**, and **frequencies**.
