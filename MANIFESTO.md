#DeconChain 

MANIFESTO.md

## I. Preamble

DeconChain is a symbolic and technical revival.  
A reboot of the values that once anchored communities before the noise of modern digital chaos.

This project is not just code — it is a **reclaiming of words, bonds, and territory**.  
We are building a **chain of meaning**, not just a chain of blocks.

---

## II. Declaration

We affirm the right to speak **in our own language**,  
and to reclaim terms such as **"déconnez-vous"**,  
which, while playful, now serve as a **shield against ridicule, co-option, and viral emptiness**.

DeconChain is not about memes.  
It is about **memory** —  
the memory of **"solidarité"**, of purpose, of local resilience.

---

## III. What We Stand For

- ✅ Rebuilding a cultural and symbolic backbone for the next cycle.
- ✅ Reconnecting **Sol** (soil, sun, return) and **Lien** (bond, tie, network).
- ✅ Archiving and preserving francophone expressions — not for nostalgia, but for defense.
- ✅ Ensuring our terms and ideas are **not plagiarized**, misused, or distorted by others.

> "Plagiarized" — meaning: taken without consent, stripped of soul, repackaged for hype.

---

## IV. What We Oppose

- ❌ The misuse or appropriation of **our native terms** in meme coins or parody tokens.
- ❌ The weaponization of **ambiguity** to hijack cultural roots for profit.
- ❌ The loss of **meaning** in favor of speculative virality.

## V. On Identity and Usage

DeconChain is **not a public domain meme**.  
It is a **protected ideological stance**, deployed in advance to prevent identity theft and misuse.  
Any use of "DeconChain", "SoLLien", "déconnez-vous", or similar identifiers  
**without express consent** may be considered **a form of "plagiat"**,  
in the cultural and symbolic sense.

## VI. Authorship and Seal

Initiated by **0xBinato**, with the counsel of **Protoss Disciplines**,

## VIII. Closing Statement

DeconChain is not a joke.  
It is a shield.
