# Project Policy – DeconChain

DeconChain is a hybrid project: political and technical.  
We support digital commons and decentralized public tools — made by and for local communities.

## ✨ Our Goals

- Support sovereignty for rural and small communities
- Build transparent, decentralized infrastructures (Web3, governance, identity, etc.)
- Include citizens, not just developers

We believe code is political — and politics needs open code.

## 🤝 Participation Rules

We welcome:
- Rural citizens and young professionals
- Freelancers and local hackers
- Couples, students, makers, and thinkers

To join:
- Be respectful (read our `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`)
- Open a **Pull Request** or **Issue** to propose changes
- Share your ideas, not just your code

## 🧭 Governance

We are building a shared governance process:
- Public decisions are discussed in Issues
- Votes (soon: token-based or open ballots)
- Maintainers guide, community decides
